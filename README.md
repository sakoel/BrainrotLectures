# Brainrot Lectures

A single-page playground that turns your painfully serious lecture notes into scrollable short-form reels.
Paste text into the generator to get a feed of meme-y study summaries you can react to and reply to—perfect for roasting exams with friends.

## Running locally

1. Open this folder in a terminal.
2. Start a static server (for example: `python -m http.server 8000`).
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and smash the **Generate Brainrot Reels** button.

## Features

- 🎬 Auto-generates up to eight “brainrot” reels from the notes you paste.
- 😂 Each reel comes with silly hooks, reaction buttons, and a reply thread.
- ⚡️ Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `Enter` (or `Cmd` + `Enter`) to trigger generation fast.
- 📱 Responsive layout with neon vibes that still works on mobile.

All client-side, so nothing leaves your browser—just vibes and maybe some study guilt.
