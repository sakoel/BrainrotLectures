# BrainrotLectures
Put ur lecture notes and have brainrot short form videos teach you


example of flow (draft 1 from chatgpt)
        User uploads lecture notes → Backend splits them into small segments.

        LLM processes and rewrites into short, catchy sentences with emojis.

        TTS + visuals generated for each segment → stored as scrollable clips.

        User scrolls through clips like Reels → can “save,” “skip,” or “quiz me.”

        Algorithm keeps showing them new clips or ones they got wrong earlier.
